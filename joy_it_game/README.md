# joy-it-game
A little game for the joy-it raspi box. It is Django/Python based and uses many of the supplied features of the box.

## Preconditions
The software has been tested on a Joy-it experimental box using an raspberry 3B+ board.
Other boards have not been checked, the software needs some resources as we start a 
web-server to get started.
You may test if the system also runs with less capable raspberry boards, but there 
is no warranty that you will succeed.

## Installation
1. Start the experimental box
2. Open a terminal
3. cd to the Desktop
4. mkdir game or equivalent
5. cd game
6. download the code from github: git clone https://github.com/tlhosep/joy-it-game
7. Once completed cd to joy-it-game
8. run ./deploy_game.sh
9. Note down the chosen admin-account and its password in case you may later on need 
   it.
9. That's all

## Start
Click on the Desktop-Icon to start the little game. The browser will start and will 
provide you with a screen to specify the email settings, as these may be needed in 
case you have forgotten your password ;) It is totally ok to just show them on the 
terminal/console for the start. If you prefer, you could configure your own mail-server 
here.
This action is only required once.
After that please register yourself in order to save some results and then start the 
game.

## Dip-settings
For each of the steps to mitigate the "bomb" please check the Dip-settings as they 
are displayed. If they are not correct, the game-level could not be played.

Have fun!
